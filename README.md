# ECG Arrhythmia Classification using Deep Learning

## Introduction
Electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmia classification is an essential task in the detection and treatment of heart diseases. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been effective in automatic arrhythmia detection and classification. This document focuses on the use of deep CNN with an attention mechanism for classification based on ECG data.

## Dataset
The **MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset** is one of the most commonly used datasets for ECG classification. It consists of 48 half-hour recordings of two-lead ECG data obtained from 47 subjects, including various arrhythmia types.

## Model Architecture
The proposed model employs a deep CNN architecture with an attention mechanism to focus on the most important features for arrhythmia classification.

### Key Components:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Used for feature extraction from the ECG signal.
2. **Attention Mechanism**: Highlights the most relevant portions of the data.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Perform the classification based on extracted features.

## Applications
This deep learning model can be integrated into healthcare systems for real-time monitoring and detection of cardiac arrhythmias. A basic application could be developed to help patients track their heart health and detect abnormal heartbeats early.
